# Goals & Objectives
The project targets the following goals and objectives:
* Provide a lightweight embeddable runtime engine to execute tasks or workflows
* The engine is used to orchestrate remote process calls synchronously as well as asynchronously
* A graphical user interface is provided to create and modify workflows

# Terminology
* Expression: Is used to access variables, calculate values and take routing decisions within a Workflow
* Condition: 
* Task: A single unit of work to execute
* Process: A runnable software component that actually executes the unit of work
* Workflow: A combination of tasks

# Market Analysis
Before we start we should analyse the market what is already out there and what are demands, requirements and targets of other existing solutions.

## OpenWMS
In the OpenWMS project an embedded BPMN workflow engine is used to do the material flow control handling. The first RfS (Request for Specification) for that solution has already
been requested in 2011, a link to the original document is [here](../_assets/10b-04-OpenWMS-RFS_Integration_Activiti_BPM.pdf)
